# ✅ What is hird Party Risk Management (TPRM)?
**Third Party Risk Management (TPRM)** is a process used by organizations to **identify, assess, manage, and monitor** the risks that arise from working with external vendors, partners, suppliers, or contractors.

**These risks can include:**
* **Cybersecurity risks** (e.g., data breaches, weak security controls)
* **Compliance risks** (e.g., failure to meet regulatory standards)
* **Operational risks** (e.g., service outages or disruptions)
* **Reputational risks** (e.g., unethical practices by vendors)

# 🧭 How to Conduct a Third Party Risk Assessment  
A simple web-based tool to assess, score, and track third-party vendor risks. **In this project,** we will:
- Load vendor data from CSV
- Ask security-related risk questions
- Calculate and Classify vendor risk level (LMH)
